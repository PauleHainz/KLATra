This is a documentation for KLATra_v1.py.

KLATra needs as input a FORTRAN namelist like the example namelist KLATra_in.in.
Inside this namelist all needed information can be passed to the software.

You can run KLATra in your command line like this:
python KLATra_v1.py -f namelist.in

-f or --file is neccessary to show that you pass the namelist file.

KLATra reads the namelist and the namelist of the KLAM_21 simulation for which trajectories should be calculated.
It checks whether there are files for the simulation begin and creates them, if neccessary.
As there is no cold air layer at that simulation time, u, v, Hx and Ex are all zero over the whole model area.

KLATra uses for the calculation of trajectories either timesteps from KLAM_21 dt file or a fixed timestep.
This can be decided in the namelist. Standard is use of KLAM_21's timesteps.

For the position in which the trajectory calculation should start, there are a number of possibilities.

If you want to use a version based on landuse, KLATra needs a polygonized version of the landuse file.
It should be saved as a .geojson and set in the namelist [at this position].
You can polygonize your raster file using gdal_polygonize.py [befehl einfügen] [weblink einfügen] in your command line.

Output can be saved as KLAM_21 compatible pl_files so that they can be viewed in KLAM_21's GUI or as geojson files.
For the geojson output two files are created - one time LineStrings and the other time Points.
It is not possible to save information for every output position of a trajectory inside the linestrings, so it is saved for each point separately.
The Linestrings are saved as well as the are useful for a first overview.
